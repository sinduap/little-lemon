              Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned
              Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served
              with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian,
              Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12-15 items that
              they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed
              atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a
              meal any time of the day.

            <p className="about__text">
              Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian,
              who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of
              owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family
              recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the
              marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu
              beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the
              Mediterranean region.
